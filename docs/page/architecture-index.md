## Contributing to Architecture Documentation

When contributing to or updating the architecture documentation:

1. **Maintain Diagram Consistency**: Use the established Mermaid diagram patterns
2. **Update Cross-References**: Ensure links between documents remain valid
3. **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use consistent terminology across documents
4. **Include Performance Considerations**: Document performance implications of changes
5. **Test Diagram Rendering**: Verify Mermaid diagrams render correctly

## Mermaid Diagram Best Practices

For optimal diagram rendering and maintenance:

- Use semantic color coding for different component types
- Keep diagrams focused on specific architectural aspects
- Include descriptive titles and legends where helpful
- Maintain consistent styling across related diagrams
- Optimize for both web viewing and potential print output

This architecture documentation serves as the foundation for understanding LSP Mode's sophisticated design and enables effective collaboration across the development community.
